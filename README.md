Dropbox Datastore API with RubyMotion
=====================================

This sample demonstrate how to use the Dropbox Datastore API with RubyMotion.

The sample is based on Dropbox documentation for iOS, as well as the sample application Tasks, written in Objective-C. As you can see, the RubyMotion code is much simpler and shorter.

Steps to get started:
- download the Dropbox SDK
- move the SDK to vendor/Dropbox.framework
- rake

Additional steps:
- open the Dropbox Tasks sample with XCode
- compile and run in the simulator
- you can now switch between both apps and see your tasks move from one app to the other

Enjoy.
